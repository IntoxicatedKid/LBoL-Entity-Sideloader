Modding framework for working with LBoL entities.

#### Change log

`0.7.8` added Sfx and uiSounds templates. Actually works nicely with template gen.

`0.7.7` added UltimateSkillTemplate.

`0.7.6` added template for EnemyUnit which governs enemy behavior. For now it only makes sense to use it with `[OverwriteVanilla]`

`0.7.5` added template for Jade Boxes.

`0.7.3` added dynamic template generation. Refer to [this](https://github.com/Neoshrimp/LBoL-Entity-Sideloader/blob/master/src/TermplateGenTests/Generation.cs) for an example.
