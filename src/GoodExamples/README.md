### Good Examples
Intended to have been a collection of example entities using Sideloader it turned to be a fully fledged, albeit very small gameplay mod. It still serves a purpose of hands-on introduction to Sideloader but can be used as a mod since the new content is (hopefully) within the game's power balance.

Sideloader templates are implemented in classes contained within `<EntityIdDefiniton.cs>` files. `CycleAbilities/RedCycleAbility.cs` and `Exhibits/FistOfTheThreeFairies.cs` overly verbose comments explaining each component loading method of the template.


Some ideas were taken from Design-and-Creativity channel. Original authors feel free to copy the code and polish these ideas to their full potential.

#### Stuff added
Exhibits (do NOT appear in the Collection currently):
- Fist of the Three Fairies (Rare)

Cards:
- Innate Dream (Reimu's Attack)
- Red Colorless Cycle (Neutral Ability)
- Flashbang (Tool)
